							<p>This model was trained using the behavioural cloning technique.
								Approximately 100,000 images were collected along with the 
								corresponding steering angles and throttle positions. This 
								training data was then given to the model to learn how to drive.
								</p>
							<p>A modified version of PilotNet was used for the model, with the only 
								difference being that there was three regression heads instead of one, 
								one for the steering angle and one for the throttle (and a final one for braking, 
								but there wasn't enough training data for this to work).</p>
							<p>Overall the model mainly learns to steer, the throttle control is less reliant. 
								With more data the model could possible generalise further. However, with the 
								addition of depth perception, optical flow estimation and scene segmentation 
								this could help the model learn better representations with similar amounts of 
								training data.
